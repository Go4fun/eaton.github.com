title: Why Hooker Had To Die - A Tale of Open Source, Inclusive Communities, and The Right To Be a Dick
---
###On March 9th, 2011, I killed *Hooker.*

- Some background, and why the joke was nerd-funny
- Why it wasn't funny
- "But I'm not THAT GUY!"
- The three possible scenarios: You're hurting people and you don't care, you think you're not but you are, you aren't hurting anyone but someone else can use your behavior as an excuse
- Ask, "Could a genuinely misogynistic person point to me to prove their behavior is OK?"
- Accept that altering our behavior is part of the price of working in a community. We clean up our language in business meetings, we put on pants when we attend presentations, and we follow coding conventions even if we think tabs are much better than spaces.
